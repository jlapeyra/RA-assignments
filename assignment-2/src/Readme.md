Run


```bash
python data.py
```

to generate `data.csv`, with the results of the experiments. This may take a few minutes. You can ajust the number of experiments performed (how many repetitions, the set of values of each parameter) in lines 11-21 of `data.py`


Run one of these scripts:
```bash
python plot1_nd.py
python plot2_nb.py
python plot3_nk.py
```

to generate the plots, which will be saved in `plots/`. The plots are generated from `data.csv`.
